        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Federal College of Education thank you for taking the time to learn more about us. We prepare
            students for work and graduate schools. We’ve been a part of the fabric of the Pakistani Academic Arena
            since our founding in 1974. Our collaborations with partners in education, i.e. National Curriculum Council,
            National Educational Assessment System (NEAS), Academy of Educational Planning and Management (AEPAM),
            National Book Foundation, Text Book Boards, Punjab University Syndicate, and Boards of Intermediate and
            Secondary Education has strengthened us and the communities we serve. Our strategic alliance with the many
            GEOs and ANGEOS is an example of the kind of partnerships that exemplify our capacity and innovation.
            Producing career-ready graduates has always been central to our mission. <br>

            It is a privilege to lead such an outstanding institution of higher learning. Our sound teacher preparation
            programs of social and natural sciences are led by distinguished faculty who are experts in their fields and
            value teaching. Our low faculty-to-student ratio allows us to have full-time faculty teaching students in
            small classes and provides ample opportunities for undergraduate research. Our programs and students from
            Bachelor to masters are a hot favorite for the job market not only in the local public and private but in
            the Gulf region. All of our undergraduate majors offer a blend of science content-focused courses along with
            the general education foundation that helps our prospective teachers to develop critical thinking, teamwork
            skills, and effective communication along with the digital learning that academic-industry employees
            increasingly demand entry-level academicians. Research is a compulsory component of FCE’s curriculum, which
            provides the students with experiences outside the classroom. <br>

            The student is the most important person on our campus. We create opportunities and inspire students to
            achieve their goals, providing them with exceptional experiences, and connections to successful careers. The
            exceptional experiences allow them to grow, develop, and explore new interests, and fully realize their
            potential. We recognize that in addition to our student's academic pursuits, they lead full, rich lives and
            need our support. Yet, FCE offers more than just a great learning experience, which broadens horizons and
            challenges assumptions. So many of our students find that the public mission of FCE seeps in, and changes
            them, in ways that help them make their way in the world and turn to make that world a better place. I
            encourage you to visit our campus and learn more about the opportunities available to you at FCE. Lastly,
            becoming an FCEian means you are part of a community of academicians that will support you from day one and
            help you achieve your vision of success. You will find a rich learning environment along with responsible
            social and cultural life, you will make connections and friendships that will last a lifetime. Our website
            contains many resources for you to learn about FCE. I encourage you to visit our beautiful campus, meet our
            students and faculty, and see for yourself the outstanding opportunities, activities, and facilities that
            FCE offers. <br>

            "I assure you that FCE’s campus community genuinely cares for the success of its students and strives to
            make their experience outstanding and life-changing."
